I have used ID3 algorithm to classify the chess pieces and predict its place
This project, "Chess Piece Classification Using ID3 Algorithm," implements the ID3 decision tree algorithm to classify chess piece movements based on a given dataset. The project involves data preprocessing using Pandas, calculating entropy and information gain, and constructing a decision tree for classification. By analyzing chess positions, the model aims to determine optimal moves or classifications based on training data.
This project explores the implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm, a fundamental decision tree learning method used in classification tasks. Using a dataset related to chess piece movements, the project processes data, applies the ID3 algorithm, and evaluates the resulting decision tree model. The implementation includes data handling with Pandas, entropy calculations, and recursive tree building.
